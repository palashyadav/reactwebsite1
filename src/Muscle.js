                        <h4>1. Eggs </h4>
                         <p>:Eggs contain high quality protein, healthy fats, and other important nutrients like B vitamins and choline (1Trusted Source).Proteins are made up of amino acids. Eggs contain large amounts of the amino acid leucine, which is particularly important for muscle gain (1, 2).B vitamins are also critically important for a variety of processes in your body, including energy production (3Trusted Source, 4). </p>


                         <h4> 2. Salmon</h4>
                         <p>:Salmon is a great choice for muscle building and overall health.Each 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of salmon contains about 17 grams of protein, 1.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids, and several important B vitamins (5Trusted Source).Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in muscular health and may even increase muscle gain during exercise programs (6Trusted Source).</p>


                         <h4>3. Chicken breast </h4>
                         <p>:There’s a good reason why chicken breasts are considered a staple for gaining muscle: They’re packed with protein. Each 3-ounce (85-gram) serving contains about 26.7 grams of high quality protein (7Trusted Source).Chicken breasts also contain generous amounts of the B vitamins niacin and B6, which may be particularly important if you are active (7Trusted Source).These vitamins help your body function properly during the physical activity that’s necessary for optimal muscle gain (4).What’s more, some research has shown that higher protein diets containing chicken may aid in fat loss (8Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>4. Greek yogurt</h4>
                         <p>: Dairy not only contains high quality protein but also a mixture of fast-digesting whey protein and slow-digesting casein protein (8Trusted Source).Some research has shown that people experience increases in lean mass when they consume a combination of fast- and slow-digesting dairy proteins (9Trusted Source).But not all dairy is created equal. For example, Greek yogurt often contains approximately double the amount of protein as regular yogurt (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).While Greek yogurt is a good snack anytime, eating it after a workout or before bed may be beneficial, due to its mixture of fast- and slow-digesting proteins (9Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>5. Tuna </h4>
                         <p>: In addition to 20 grams of protein per 3-ounce (85-gram) serving, tuna contains high amounts of vitamin A and several B vitamins, including B12, niacin, and B6. These nutrients are important for optimal health, energy, and exercise performance (4, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).Additionally, tuna provides large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which may support muscle health (6Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).This may be particularly important for older adults. Research has shown that omega-3 fatty acids can slow the loss of muscle mass and strength that occurs with age (15Trusted Source).</p>

                         
                         
                         <h4>6. Shrimp</h4>
                         <p>: Shrimp are almost pure protein. Each 3-ounce (85-gram) serving contains 19 grams of protein, 1.44 gram of fat, and 1 gram of carbs (21Trusted Source).While healthy fats and carbs are important in your overall diet, adding some shrimp is an easy way to get muscle building protein without too many additional calories.Like many other animal proteins, shrimp contains a high amount of the amino acid leucine, which is necessary for optimal muscle growth (21, 22Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>7. Whey Protein</h4>
                         <p>: Whey protein is pretty impressive.It’s been shown to promote muscle growth when combined with exercise and may help preserve muscle during weight loss (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).In addition, whey protein seems to be even more effective at suppressing appetite than other protein sources.This is because it stimulates the release of “fullness hormones,” such as PYY and GLP-1, to a greater extent.</p>

                         <h4>8. Soybeans</h4>
                         <p>: Half a cup (86 grams) of cooked soybeans contains 16 grams of protein, healthy unsaturated fats, and several vitamins and minerals (23Trusted Source).Soybeans are a particularly good source of vitamin K, iron, and phosphorus (23Trusted Source).Iron is used to store and transport oxygen in your blood and muscles, and a deficiency can impair these functions (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source).People who menstruate may be particularly at risk of iron deficiency due to blood loss during their cycle (26).</p>

                         <h4>9. Cottage cheese</h4>
                         <p>: One cup (226 grams) of low fat cottage cheese packs 28 grams of protein, including a hearty dose of the important muscle building amino acid leucine (27Trusted Source).Like other dairy products, cottage cheese can be purchased with varying fat contents. High fat versions like creamed cottage cheese have more calories.Choosing which type of cottage cheese is best simply depends on how many extra calories you want to add to your diet. Regardless of which type you choose, it’s a great muscle building snack.</p>

                         <h4>10. Turkey breast</h4>
                         <p>A 3-ounce (85-gram) serving of turkey breast contains around 26 grams of protein and almost no fat or carbs (28Trusted Source).Turkey is also a good source of the B vitamin niacin, which helps process fats and carbohydrates in your body (29Trusted Source).Having optimal levels of B vitamins could help you gain muscle over time by supporting your body’s ability to exercise (30Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>11. Tilapia</h4>
                         <p> Although it doesn’t have as much omega-3 fatty acids as salmon, tilapia is another protein-packed seafood item.A single (87-gram) fillet provides around 23 grams of protein, along with good amounts of vitamin B12 and selenium (31Trusted Source).Vitamin B12 is important for the health of your blood cells and nerves, which allows you to perform the exercise you need to gain muscle (32).</p>

                         <h4>12. Beans</h4>
                         <p>Many different types of beans can be part of a diet for lean muscle gain.Popular varieties — such as black, pinto, and kidney beans — contain around 15 grams of protein per cup (about 172 grams) of cooked beans (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).What’s more, they are excellent sources of fiber and B vitamins, in addition to being high in magnesium, phosphorus, and iron. For these reasons, beans are a good source of plant-based protein to add to your diet.What’s more, they may play a role in long-term health and disease prevention (36Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>13. Protein powders</h4>
                         <p>While any good diet should focus on whole foods, there are times when dietary supplements can be beneficial (37Trusted Source).If you have trouble getting enough protein from foods alone, you could consider adding protein shakes to your daily routine.Dairy protein powders, such as whey and casein, are some of the most popular. Other protein powders use soy, pea, beef, or chicken protein.You can find a variety of protein powders online.</p>

                         <h4>14. Edamame</h4>
                         <p>Edamame is the term for immature soybeans. These developing beans are found in pods and served in a variety of dishes, particularly those of Japanese origin.One cup (155 grams) of frozen edamame provides around 18 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber. It also contains large amounts of folate, vitamin K, and manganese (38Trusted Source).Among other functions, folate helps your body process amino acids, the building blocks of protein (39Trusted Source).In fact, folate may be important for optimal muscle mass and strength, particularly in older adults (40).</p>

                         <h4>15. Peanuts</h4>
                         <p>Peanuts contain a mix of protein, fat, and carbs. A 1-ounce (28-gram) serving contains 7 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbs, and large amounts of unsaturated fat (47Trusted Source).They also contain higher amounts of the amino acid leucine than many other plant products.Each 1-ounce (28-gram) serving of peanuts contains around 166 calories (47Trusted Source).If you’re having a hard time getting enough calories to drive your muscle gain, eating peanuts could be a good way to get some extra calories and nutrients.Additionally, nuts are thought to play an important role in an overall healthy diet (48Trusted Source).
