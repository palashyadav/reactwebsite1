                        <h4>1. Salmon</h4>
                         <p>:Salmon is a fantastic source of high-quality protein which is beneficial for weight and fat loss as the body must work harder to digest it. In addition, salmon is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids which are shown to reduce inflammation and promote fat burning, with studies showing that fish oil supplementation can help to reduce weight and the stress hormone cortisol, which is also linked to fat storage. </p>


                         <h4> 2. Greek Yogurt</h4>
                         <p>:Greek yogurt can really help with fat burning but it needs to be the full fat variety,” says Suzie, a clinical nutritionist from Feel Alive UK(opens in new tab).“Firstly, full-fat Greek yogurt contains conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) which promotes fat burning. And secondly, probiotics naturally found in the yogurt support the good gut bacteria which is key to any weight loss programme.</p>


                         <h4>3. Dark Chocolate</h4>
                         <p>: Dark chocolate is packed with monounsaturated fatty acids which help boost your metabolism," says David. "And as a result, you will burn calories faster. However, when choosing dark chocolate, check the ingredients as many are still packed full of sugar.</p>

                         <h4>4. Broccoli</h4>
                         <p>: According to researchers, broccoli contains calcium, which is good for healthy joints and weight loss. One University of Tennessee study(opens in new tab) found that calcium in fact controls how fat is processed and stored in the body. And that the more calcium in a fat cell, the more fat that cell will burn.</p>

                         <h4>5. Nuts</h4>
                         <p>: They're a good source of protein, and as such they require the body to use more energy during the digestive process which can boost your metabolism and help burn more calories,</p>

                         <h4>6. Green Tea</h4>
                         <p>:“Green tea is known to be thermogenic, or a fat-burner,” Suzie tells us. “It’s loaded with antioxidants called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which helps speed up metabolism.  Plus green tea also contains a small amount of caffeine, and research has found it to speed up metabolic rate and increase fat-burning if drunk before exercise.</p>

                         <h4>7. Eggs</h4>
                         <p>: Eggs are one high-protein food(opens in new tab) that can promote fat-burning,” she says. “Protein speeds up metabolic rate, which can be as much as 30% after eating high-quality protein. Furthermore, protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle mass, and the more muscle you have, the more metabolically active you’ll be.</p>

                         <h4>8. Avocado</h4>
                         <p>: those who ate this fat-burning food for breakfast or lunch were less likely to over-eat during the rest of the day.</p>

                         <h4>9. Beans</h4>
                         <p>White beans such as cannellini beans act as alpha-amylase inhibitors, which means they can slow down the absorption of carbohydrates by blocking the enzymes needed for their digestion. This means you do not get a high blood sugar spike after eating them, which can result in the laying down of more fat around the body.</p>

                         <h4>10. Chicken</h4>
                         <p>Lean protein sources, like chicken, actually take more energy (or calories) to digest than simple carbs do,” she tells us.  “Eating lean protein also protects your muscle mass when you’re in a calorie deficit, and lean mass burns more calories than fat.</p>

                         <h4>11. Blueberries</h4>
                         <p>Blueberries, and other berries, have a high water content and are lower in sugar than other fruits without sacrificing sweetness,” says dietician Claire. “Their high antioxidant content helps keep you healthy, too.</p>

                         <h4>12. Whole grains</h4>
                         <p>Whole grains such as oats and quinoa are high in fibre, which can enhance weight loss, digestion, and blood sugar levels,” says nutritionist David. “Eating whole grains has also shown to reduce appetite and influence your body’s energy use, both of which can affect body composition.</p>

                         <h4>13. Chia seeds</h4>
                         <p>Small but mighty, chia seeds have many benefits(opens in new tab) – many of which are thanks to their protein and fibre content,” she tells us. “They can turn liquids into thicker substances – think chia pudding(opens in new tab) or adding into your oatmeal. And they provide minerals and vitamins to support the conversion of fat to energy.</p>

                         <h4>14. Chillies</h4>
                         <p>Chillies can help to stimulate the metabolism, having a thermogenic effect which speeds up the metabolism and the rate at which your body uses energy.</p>
