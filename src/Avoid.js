                        <p>Sorry to break it to you, but even though there are some foods you simply just can't ever seem to resist (we're talking cookies, nachos, onion rings—the stuff that taste oh so good) they're just not the best for you healthwise. It's these nutrient-deficient foods you're going to want to avoid, as they can truly wreck your body, especially if you're trying to make healthier choices during these times when it's much easier to just load up on junk food. And due to food manufacturers and deceptive marketers, even some of your seemingly "healthy" meals are filled with unhealthy fats, artificial ingredients, and unnecessary preservatives that are hazardous to your health, too.On a mission to help you understand exactly what exactly is in your food, and why it's bad, we put together this list of the least nutritious foods on the planet that are so toxic, they just wreck your body.</p>


                        <h4>1. Bleached White Flour Bread</h4>
                         <p>:Even if your bread's first ingredient is "wheat flour"—keep reading. If it doesn't mention that it's unbleached, you're likely noshing on a sandwich laced with creepy chemicals. Some manufacturers use an ingredient called azodicarbonamide, which you might recall is the "yoga mat" additive that Subway once controversially used. This plastic dough conditioner is used to make bread dough fluffier. The CSPI agrees you should avoid it, citing evidence that the chemicals azodicarbonamide break down into after baking are recognized carcinogens. </p>


                         <h4> 2.Diet Sodas</h4>
                         <p>:What do artificial colors, flame retardants, and waist-widening fake sugars all have in common? They're ingredients in all your favorite diet fizzy drinks. Nearly all popular diet sodas contain aspartame, an artificial sweetener that was initially developed to aid weight loss, but that has recently been found to have the opposite effect, raising glucose levels, overloading the liver, and causing the excess to convert into fat, according to a study in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.</p>


                         <h4>3.Deep Fried Foods</h4>
                         <p>:Fried chicken, fried calamari, pork rinds, chicken-fried steak. You won't ever see these items marked as an "Eat This." Besides the high fat and calorie content, the main issue with these fried foods is that they contain high levels of inflammatory Advanced Glycation End products, or AGEs. These compounds form when animal-derived products are cooked at high temperatures for a prolonged period of time. According to a 2015 review published in the journal Advances in Nutrition, experts concluded that "sustained exposure to [AGEs] gradually erodes native defenses, setting the stage for abnormally high [oxidative stress] and inflammation, the precursors of disease.</p>

                         <h4>4.Sugary Cereal</h4>
                         <p>:There's no sugar-coating it: sugar wreaks havoc on the body. Consuming too much of the white stuff can lead to obesity, which often causes other health problems like diabetes and heart disease. And many cereals pack more sugar into one bowl than you'll find in a Boston Cream Donut! To make matters worse, many popular varieties like Frosted Flakes and Fruity Pebbles are also laced with Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) or BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole), ingredients that are banned in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and much of Europe because they are thought to be carcinogenic.

                         <h4>5.Frozen Entrées</h4>
                         <p>: Freezing food is a terrific way to make it last longer, so why add preservatives? Unfortunately, manufacturers do; just witness this list of the 67 Worst Frozen Foods in America.</p>

                         
                         
                         <h4>6.White Sugar</h4>
                         <p>:According to the Pew Research Center, Americans ate over 90 grams of added sugar a day in 2014—which is 40 grams above the FDA's recommended intake of 50 grams per day and a whopping 65 grams above the World Health Organization's recommended intake of 25 grams! Americans' high consumption of refined, white sugar has been linked to everything from increased risk of type 2 diabetes to heart disease to obesity. Say goodbye to added sugars—and goodbye to your belly—with the Zero Sugar Diet!</p>

                         <h4>7.Bottled Smoothies</h4>
                         <p>:Busy mornings and grab-and-go breakfasts are practically synonymous—so it's easy to see the appeal of store-bought smoothies. They seem like the best way to get what you crave in a pinch. But the timesaving drinks have a downside: Compared to fresh-made drinks, most of them fall short on nutrition and are so calorie- and sugar-filled that your blood sugar is sure to skyrocket. Just take Naked's Pomegranate Blueberry smoothie as an example: Downing this entire bottle will fill you up with a whopping 61 grams of sugar and absolutely zero fiber. Be sure to avoid The Worst "Healthy" Store-Bought Juices to keep your waistline trim.</p>

                         <h4>8.Fast Food</h4>
                         <p>:You may not know how to pronounce it, but you should know what phthalates (thāl-ates) are. That's because many of us are unknowingly eating this class of endocrine-disrupting chemical toxins. Similar to BPA, phthalates are used in plastic food and beverage wrappers and packaging—and they're not staying there. In 2016, an Environmental Health Perspectives study found that people who ate fast food often had dose-dependent higher levels of phthalate compounds than infrequent eaters. And that's just the beginning of bad news for all-day-breakfast lovers, since a separate study published in Environmental Science & Technology found phthalates to be associated with the CRP marker of inflammation, and another study in Environmental Health connected higher exposure to phthalates with metabolic syndrome, a disease also commonly associated with increased levels of inflammation and weight gain.</p>

                         <h4>9.Ice Cream</h4>
                         <p>: When you're missing out on creamy milk, manufacturers turn to the chemistry lab to make up for the lack of flavor and texture. One additive—polysorbate 80 (P80)—helps to give diet ice cream its addictive creamy texture and long shelf life, but it harms your health. Georgia State University researchers previously linked the emulsifier with low-grade inflammation in the intestine. Not a good sign. You'll find this additive in Turkey Hill Light Recipe, Vanilla Bean.</p>

                         <h4>10.Mayonnaise</h4>
                         <p>Mayo ranks among the worst of the empty-calorie condiments, and even non-fat varieties aren't any better, considering the sugar and preservatives they contain. Plus, the fact that mayo is made with eggs but can happily sit, unrefrigerated, on a supermarket shelf for months without breaking down or separating is forever concerning.</p>

                         <h4>11.Soybean Oil</h4>
                         <p>t's found in so many processed and packaged foods, but soybean oil may be just as bad for you as sugar. There are studies that claim the oil can be linked to obesity and harm liver function.</p>

                         <h4>12.Chinese Food</h4>
                         <p>There really is nothing quite like some takeout and Chinese food is often a meal many like to order in. But the problem with these favorites is that they are loaded in sodium.</p>

                         <h4>13.Cookies</h4>
                         <p>Nabisco still uses artery-clogging, brain-draining fats in their Chips Ahoy! Chocolate chip cookies. And on top of that, if the 11 grams of sugar per serving wasn't enough to deter you, they're made with high fructose corn syrup, which can increase body weight, body fat, and triglyceride levels, according to a Princeton University study.</p>
