                        <h4>1. Greek Yogurt</h4>
                         <p>:yogurt — and other fermented foods like sauerkraut — are good sources of probiotics, which can enhance your gut microbiome and help you heal," says Pauline Jose, MD, a clinical instructor at UCLA and family medicine specialist at pH Labs, a national nonprofit health information organization. </p>


                         <h4> 2. Chicken Soup</h4>
                         <p>:A staple food for anyone who has a fever, chicken soup clears our nasal passages (by thinning mucous) when we have congestion, helps us keep warm when we have the shivers and offers some amino acids that help fight the flu.</p>


                         <h4>3. Coconut Water</h4>
                         <p>:o keep your body performing at its prime, you need to stay hydrated. Filling up on fluids helps modulate your body temperature, inhibits infection and transports necessary nutrients to your cells, according to Harvard Health Publishing.This is especially important if you're feverish and losing water through perspiration. A phenomenal hydrator, coconut water helps replenish the vital fluids and essential electrolytes you squander as a result of sweating or diarrhea, per the Mayo Clinic.Plus, unlike plain old H2O, it's rich in potassium, which your muscles and nerves need to function properly and your body requires to regulate your heartbeat, Largeman-Roth says.</p>

                         <h4>4. Fruits</h4>
                         <p>: When you have a fever, fruits are your friend. "Most fruits contain at least 80 percent water, so they are wonderful for rehydrating, plus many contain a significant amount of vitamin C, which is essential for immune response, as well as cell repair," Largeman-Roth says.</p>

                         <h4>5. Cooked Vegetables</h4>
                         <p>: Like fruits, veggies supply a surplus of vital vitamins and much-needed minerals that can support the immune system and help you get rid of a fever, Dr. Jose says. Specifically, she recommends vegetables like carrots, onions and celery, which you can toss into a pot of homemade chicken soup.</p>

                         
                         
                         <h4>6. High-Protein Foods</h4>
                         <p>: When it comes to infection-fighting nutrients, protein is at the top of the list. That's because your body needs protein to develop antibodies, which help protect you from invading pathogens, Robert Segal, MD, founder of Medical Offices of Manhattan, tells LIVESTRONG.com.Largeman-Roth agrees: "Protein-rich foods like beans, nuts, lean meat and poultry contain the minerals selenium and zinc, which are vital for a healthy immune system," she says. Eggs — which also contain vitamin D (a micronutrient essential for immune function) — are another abundant source of protein.</p>

                         <h4>7. Garlic and Ginger</h4>
                         <p>: Aged garlic extract may also enhance your immune cell function and, consequently, temper a cold's symptoms, according to a June 2012 study in ‌Clinical Nutrition‌.Ginger is another spice that can support the immune system. "Gingerol, its active compound, has medicinal properties that aid with inflammation, nausea and vomiting, among other symptoms.</p>

                         <h4>8. Broths</h4>
                         <p>:Like chicken soup, broths are excellent sources of fluid and electrolytes that can be helpful when you’re sick. When hot, they may also help relieve sinus congestion.They’re full of flavor and rich in a variety of nutrients while still being easy on your digestive system (6Trusted Source).Additionally, bone broths are rich in collagen and amino acids (building blocks of protein) from animal bones, which may help promote a faster recovery, although research is still lacking.If you need to follow a salt-restricted diet, make sure you choose low sodium or no-salt-added broths if buying premade broths from the grocery store.</p>

                         <h4>9. Hot tea</h4>
                         <p>: Tea is a favorite remedy for many symptoms associated with colds and the flu.Just like chicken soup, hot tea acts as a natural decongestant. The tea needs to be hot to help relieve congestion, but it shouldn’t be so hot that it further irritates your throat.Although some teas do contain caffeine, tea doesn’t appear to contribute to dehydration or to cause any increased water loss (13Trusted Source).This means sipping on tea throughout the day is a great way to stay hydrated while relieving congestion.Tea also contains polyphenols. These natural substances found in plants may have a large number of possible health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and even potential anticancer effects.</p>

                         <h4>10. Honey</h4>
                         <p>Honey may also stimulate the immune system. Many people use local raw honey to relieve seasonal allergies, but there’s currently no research to support this use for honey (21Trusted Source).Additionally, honey may help suppress cough in children. However, it shouldn’t be given to children under 12 months old due to the risk of contamination with botulism-causing bacteria.</p>

                         <h4>11. Spicy foods</h4>
                         <p> In high enough concentrations, capsaicin can have a desensitizing effect. It’s often used in pain-relieving gels and patches (29Trusted Source).Many people report that eating spicy foods causes a runny nose, breaking up mucus and clearing out the sinus passages.While few studies have tested this effect, capsaicin does seem to thin out mucus, making it easier to expel. Nasal capsaicin sprays have been used with good results to relieve congestion and itching</p>

                         <h4>12. Beans</h4>
                         <p>Many different types of beans can be part of a diet for lean muscle gain.Popular varieties — such as black, pinto, and kidney beans — contain around 15 grams of protein per cup (about 172 grams) of cooked beans (33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).What’s more, they are excellent sources of fiber and B vitamins, in addition to being high in magnesium, phosphorus, and iron. For these reasons, beans are a good source of plant-based protein to add to your diet.What’s more, they may play a role in long-term health and disease prevention (36Trusted Source).</p>

                         <h4>13. Bananas</h4>
                         <p>Bananas are a great food to eat when you’re sick. They’re soft and bland but rich in nutrients and fast-acting carbs. The potassium in bananas can help replenish your electrolyte stores as well, since potassium is one of the key electrolytes your body needs (34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source).Another big benefit of bananas is the soluble fiber they contain. Soluble fiber becomes a gel in the presence of liquid, so it can help reverse diarrhea by reducing the amount of free water in your digestive tract.</p>

                         <h4>14. Oatmeal</h4>
                         <p>Like bananas, oatmeal is bland and easy to eat but also provides calories, vitamins, and minerals you need when you’re sick.One study in rats found that beta-glucan, a type of fiber in oats, helped decrease inflammation in the gut. But more research is needed to determine whether it could have a similar effect in humans and be useful for relieving digestive symptoms.</p>

                         <h4>13. Avocados</h4>
                         <p>vocados are rich in healthy monounsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals (47Trusted Source).They’re a great food to eat when sick because they provide calories, vitamins, and minerals that your body needs. They’re also soft, relatively bland, and easy to eat.Because of the healthy fats avocados contain, especially oleic acid (the same beneficial fatty acid found in olive oil), they may help decrease inflammation while playing a role in immune function .
